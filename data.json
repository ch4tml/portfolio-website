      "description": "First project. A daunting task, having only just completed tutorials on front-end technologies. This project was a slow-burner, adding new sections as projects were completed and technologies were learned. The portfolio was then adapted and reconstructed in Node.js and Express.js, using the EJS view engine The current portfolio resides has been deployed to Heroku.",

      "description": "Second project built as part of FCC curriculum. A fun little project which used an array of quotes and a random number generator to select one. One interesting aspect of this project adapting the quotes to fit with Twitter's 140 character maximum. This mean that longer quotes had to be shortened with sufficient space to allow author attribution.",

The arithmetic functions were easy to define, but the challenge was in storing and reading the order in which keys were pressed and subsequently performing the operation.
